# Cell_Manufacturing_Tolerance_Effects
Uses a DFN cell model with lithium plating to understand the effects of anode thickness manufacturing tolerances on fast-charging performance. Runs the model with N samples (N=10 by default) at each tolerance level and outputs i) average capacity lost to plating ii) average amount of charge in 10 minutes and iii) % of cells with lithium plating.
